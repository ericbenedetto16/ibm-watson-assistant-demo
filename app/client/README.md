# React Front-End Using Material UI

This Front-End Application uses [Material UI React](https://material-ui.com/) to create a simple chat interface. Using React Hooks for State Management, the application makes asynchronous requests to the [client server](../server) to communicate with the IBM Watson Assistant.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Setup your .env file (If you are keeping the default port for the [client server](../server)) or not deploying the client server, you can copy the [example env](./.env.example) into your own .env file)

### Installing

- `npm i`

### Starting the App

- `npm start`
